This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

As always you can start this app with npm start in root directory, but before you must run backend server.

To install dependencies for server [json-server] (https://github.com/typicode/json-server) you must run terminal in the
"server" folder and run "npm install".
After installing dependencies you can run json-server.
In this app i start this server on localhost:4000, that's why you must server in another terminal with next command -
"json-server -p 4000 db.json"
